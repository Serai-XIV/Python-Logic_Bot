Logical_Symbols
==============

This module defines a dictionary of logical operator symbols. The dictionary
contains entries for different logical operators, such as negation, conjunction,
and material conditional, and provides a list of symbols that can be used to
represent each operator.

The dictionary can be used as a reference for logical operator symbols, and
can be easily updated and extended to add more operators or symbols.
